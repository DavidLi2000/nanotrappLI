title: On Casimir-Polder interactions and surfaces implemented in nanotrappy
---

Van der Waals interactions (also called Casimir-Polder forces) tend to bring the atoms closer to the surface. They depend on the atom, its atomic level and on the material they are approaching.

Their action is only on very short distances (usually on the order of 100nm) but when looking at atoms close to surface with high refractive index, they sometimes have to be taken into account.
Our approach is to set surfaces, for now only Cylinders and Planes which match the surface of interest of our waveguide.
